# Personal Wallpapers

Repository to easily transfer my personal wallpapers.

On Linux, you can clone the repo into a designated folder (e.g. ~/Pictures/Wallpapers) and then make a symbolic link of the folder to `/usr/share/wallpapers/` 
to make them appear when you configure your desktop (e.g. In KDE, right click then configure desktop):
  `sudo ln -s ~/Pictures/Wallpapers /usr/share/wallpapers`

Open to the public.
